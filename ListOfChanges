1 - if statement combing out repeated elements in dihedral list before printing,

2 - changed the second [ dihedrals ] heading to [ impropers ]

3 - changed dihedral list from 4 to 6 columns as by the R-B definition for Gmx/OPLS:
	C_0 = V_0 + V_1 + 0.50d0 * (V_1 + V_3)
	C_1 = 0.50d0 * (3V_3 - V_1)
	C_2 = -V_2
	C_3 = -2.0d0 * V_3
	C_4 = 0.0d0
	C_5 = 0.0d0		(note subscripts - code counts from 1, not 0)

4 - printing [ defaults ] and [ atomtypes ] to `ff.itp` file and included OPLS definitions
    of TIP3P water needed for solvation in GMX - as it doesn't read OPLS FF from library.
